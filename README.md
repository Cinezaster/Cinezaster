### Welcome

I'm Toon Nelissen a maker, creator and developer/manager @Appsaloon.
I aspire to be a free spirited polymath and explorer.

As a developer I get results fast when I'm going full MERN (React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB) stack.
Also I like the connection between coding and the fysical world, and did my fair bit of making Arduino related projects in the past. 

In my current role as manager, I'm trying to earn my leadership by living up to my core values of openness, empathy, creativity, ownership and passion.
